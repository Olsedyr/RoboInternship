	* 708 products from left (708Program.statemachine)

2007-06-15  Mads Lundstrom  <mil@mpnrobotics.com>

	* Added support for udpagents. Small server/clients that communicate statemachine values across platforms (to upman for instance).

2007-06-13  Michael Jessen  <mvj@mpnrobotics.com>

	* Changed 701 to use Servo.
	* TODO:
	* dio update and KasseLoader2 needs Motor instead of Skub
	* Check up on 502
	* Servo CaseStop and the photocell not being adjustable.

2007-06-12  Michael Jessen  <mvj@mpnrobotics.com>

	* Changes made during first visit to Saransk:
	* 904ServoShuttle: homed = 0 when photos not found in ST_RUN_SEARCH_PHOTO
	* Switch language to english during login

	* Added B and C home sensor indicators to formJogAxis
	* Added plus/minus to select axis number
	* Added Manometer to all robot  workcells
	* Added Scissor Secure to all scissors
	* Added ST_X_ABORT to all ProgramB2.statemachine and Tool.statemachine
	* All Tool.statemachine start in ST_PAUSE

	* Added fourier analysis support to the scope function. Also added differential support. 
	The shared library libfftw3.so is now required for robostacker to compile properly. 
	Get it from samba/devel on the server (use option --enable-shared for ./configure, then make, make install).
	Add /usr/local/lib/ to /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig
	* The flash-image has been updated with libfftw3.so.

2007-05-11  Mads Lundstrom  <mil@mpnrobotics.com>

	* Split up tmpnStatemachineLoad() into two stages (tmpnStatemachineLoad() and tmpnStateLoad())
	, where the first one loads all declarations (in the stm-file itself and include-files), and the second one
	loads all states, and performs getFunctionBody() on each state. This resolves bug where an output set
	to "dummyOut" in the include-file results in wrong output-type in the ARG-struct. 

2007-05-22  Michael Jessen  <mvj@mpnrobotics.com>

	* Added user keyword to cppattern and item. When 0 the item or cppattern can not be saved.
